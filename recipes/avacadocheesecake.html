    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ ripe avocados, peeled and pitted</li>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>1 (8 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Heat cream in a small saucepan until small bubbles appear around the edges. Remove from the heat and stir in sugar until it dissolves. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl and allow to cool, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li> Blend avocado and cream cheese in a food processor until smooth. Add lime juice and process until smooth.</li>
        <li>Whisk blended avocado mixture into cooled cream mixture, then pour into an ice cream maker. Freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon avocado mixture into the prepared pie crust; smooth the surface with a spatula. Freeze until solid, at least 2 hours. Let cheesecake sit at room temperature until slightly softened yet firm enough to slice before serving, 10 to 15 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
